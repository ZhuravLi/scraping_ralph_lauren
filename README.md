# Scraping Ralph Lauren

## Part 1. Scraping
Folders `cloth_imgs` and `person_imgs` contain scraped images fron Ralph Lauren webpage.
Files of `.txt` format contain urls of each item and each image that has been used.

File `scrape.py` contains code for scrapping (`scrape_images()`). Note that your results after running this code may differ from that I have in folders (since website is changing). 
The function `fix_scraped_images` is needed 
since there are items on the website that either does not have human model or contain pics that have two models on the same picture.

## Part 2. Change background
See `change_background.ipynb`.
